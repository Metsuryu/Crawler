# Crawler
A snake clone.

I made the site mainly to demonstrate the technologies of the MEAN stack, the game was made later to give it some purpose.

You can play the game at http://crawler.cloudno.de/


Crawler TODOs:
- Change music to my own when it's ready.
- Replace title with logo when it's ready.
- Translate to Italian
- Clean up code.

Rest of the site TODOs:

- Add a search function for the highscores
- Add special commands in search function (sorting, filters, advanced search...)
- Add autocomplete to search with regex. When writing, change in real time the name of a variable 
	(maybe with Angular databinding),then search the json with the db entries for a match, 
	and show 4 or 5 of the matching results under the text-box
	the user can select/click the suggestion to autocomplete, and it will search automatically.
- Make a mobile view (detect if user is on mobile, and give them that view instead of standard one.)
- Order and clean up everything
