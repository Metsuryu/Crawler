# Crawler
A snake clone.

I made the site mainly to demonstrate the technologies of the MEAN stack, the game was made later to give it some purpose.

You can play the game at http://crawler.cloudno.de/

# Features
- Game developed with [**p5js**](https://p5js.org/).
- The scores are saved on a **MongoDB** server.
- The table with the highscores is generated automatically with **AngularJS**.
- The back-end uses **Express** and **Node.js**.


Crawler TODOs:

- Clean up code.

Rest of the site TODOs:

- Fix search function so it also finds results that are on other pages.
- Make a mobile view (detect if user is on mobile, and give them that view instead of standard one.)
- Make game compatible with touchscreens, and use it in place of the standard one if touch is detected.
- Order and clean up everything.
